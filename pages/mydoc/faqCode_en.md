**Brief description：** 

Not receiving verification code：

- Check if the account was entered correctly.
- Check if the phone number used is in blacklist. For email, please check for blocking or spam.
- When creating an account, double check if the account has been taken. Verification code won’t be sent to existing account.
- When resetting password, check if the account has been registered. Unregistered account will not receive any verification code.
